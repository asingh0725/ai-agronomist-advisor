# 🌱 AI Agronomist Advisor
*A full-stack AI system for generating crop-specific recommendations from soil test data.*

---

## 🌟 Overview

**AI Agronomist Advisor** is an in-progress full-stack application designed to help agronomists and crop advisors turn soil test data into clear, structured recommendations. The system will leverage:

- **LLMs** (OpenAI / Claude)  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
- **pgvector** for embeddings  
- **Next.js** for the frontend  
- **NestJS** for the backend  

The goal is to build a production-quality AI product that combines real agronomy domain knowledge with modern applied AI engineering patterns.

---

## 🏗️ Repository Structure (Initial Skeleton)
/frontend    – Next.js client (planned)
/backend     – NestJS API + RAG/LLM services (planned)
/ingestion   – Document ingestion + embeddings (planned)

This repository will expand as development progresses.  
For now, it provides a clean foundation for a full-stack AI system.

## 🚧 Current Status

This project is in its **initial setup** stage.

Upcoming milestones include:

- Backend setup (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL)  
- Soil test input UI (Next.js + shadcn/ui)  
- Basic OpenAI/Claude model integration  
- RAG pipeline using pgvector  
- Structured JSON recommendations with validation  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build an AI system capable of generating **accurate, structured agricultural recommendations**  
- Implement practical **retrieval-augmented generation** for real-world domain knowledge  
- Showcase full-stack **AI product engineering** skills  
- Create a polished, portfolio-quality project demonstrating modern AI development end-to-end
